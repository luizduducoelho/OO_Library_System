# OO_Library_System
Object Oriented application in C++ to build a library system with a command line interface.

To run, you can open the project in DevC++ program, or compile everything and execute main. 
The Library is made to be used using the command line interface. All operation are set in there.
Still in development, needing to add a function to store the system's information to disk, 
and reload if from there, otherwise all info will be loss when closong program. 

Obs: build using C++ 98 in Windows.
